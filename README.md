# GridAlive

GridAlive is a new experimentation framework offering a handy **full lab ecosystem** to model and study a large class of power system problems. 

More specifically, it let one model time-dependant and decision-making problems such as real-time power grid operations or future grid development. 
Recent **competitions along NeurIPS 2020 conference** tackled such problems indeed (see https://l2rpn.chalearn.org/ for more information). 
These competitions demonstrated the richfullness of GridALive framework to design and run such large scale experiments, which now turn into benchmarks that help the research community make new advances at large.
